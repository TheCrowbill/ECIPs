### Abstract

The Ethereum Classic blockchain has been operated and maintained since its inception by a user and developer community without a formal method of governance having been established.  This ECIP addresses that concern by defining ETC's governance requirements, describing a specific model to meet those requirements, and specifying the technological parameters to be used within the governance model and its implementation in the Ethereum Classic protocol.     

### Motivation

TheDAO changed everything. In adversity, the promised "autonomous" quality of smart contracts on blockchain technology faltered. Autonomy and decentralization were soon replaced by dictatorially imposed, cyclopean and monochromatic decisions invoking both a literal and philosophical about-face, reversing an established policy of immutability, sidestepping autonomy, even altering the nature of time itself within the blockchain in order to "unfeel" the undesirable consequences of deliberate actions intentionally taken though poorly executed.

Ethereum Classic exists today as an actively developed blockchain technology because we, its community of developers, investors, miners and users, determined that the Ethereum Foundation's decision to abandon it as a depricated fork of Ethereum was not properly derived through consensus: a matter of governance. It has been said that there was no adequate debate of options nor formal definition of planned actions disclosed by the Ethereum Foundation for discussion and modification prior to implementation: a matter of governance. A common opinion among members of the ETC community is that the Foundation acted unilaterally without even seeking a consensus-based solution, then feigned a concocted quasi-consensus as an afterthought, when deciding to enact the immutability-breaking hard fork: a matter of governance. More accurately, these are rather each matters which arise from the very lack of governance, in plan and in practice. 

We, the disenfranchised opposition to these past breaches of principle, herewith establish a means to ensure that Ethereum Classic, immutable and unbroken, is well-equipped with the tools of governance with which it can hold true to the principle of "applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference."
